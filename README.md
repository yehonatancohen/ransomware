# Ransomware

!!EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY!!
This ransomware was a cyber project me and my friend did
The ransomware is a exe file (not included) of the python file,
The ransomware encrypts all the victim's computer file using a public key (except for windows files and such)
Then it opens a browser on a server we created (using aws s3) where it requests money in some way and if the payment acceptes he gets a private key
Then the server automatically downloads the private key to the victim's downloads folder where the malware is looking for the private key
So after paying the malware will automatically decrypt the victim's computer
There's a decsription.txt where we have a in-depth explanation of our proccess and more detailed proccess of the malware
